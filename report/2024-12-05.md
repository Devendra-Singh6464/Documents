Dear Sir,
I did the following tasks today.

1. We have reinstalled Android Studio Ladybug, and some plugins and uninstalled the old Android Studio ladybug version of the Mahesh system.
2. PHP version 8.2 and 8.3 installed on Anil's system.
3. Vipin had requested to disable these PHP extensions dom, fileinfo, gd, into, mbstring, and pdo_mysql on his system, and we disabled them. After some time, he again asked us to enable all PHP extensions, and we did so.
4. Ayush requested to uninstall Redis, and we installed the Redis service and Redis PHP extension. After checking the issue, he again asked us to install Redis, and we reinstalled the Redis service and Redis PHP extension.
5. Downloaded the video shared by the customer to Google Drive and made it available to Gajendra.
6. Tushar requested to install some dependencies, so I installed them.
7. Rajneesh's system was not starting. We checked and found the problem is that 1 RAM is corrupted, so we replaced the RAM, and the system is working fine.
8. Regular ERP Tasks.
