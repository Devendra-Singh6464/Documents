Dear Sir,
I did the following tasks today.

1. Downloaded the files from the Google Drive link provided and shared the files with Abhishek.
2. Aakash's VS code and system packages updated.
3. I was physically going through an internal audit of the sets and equipment.
Motherboard problem in Bharat system. We replaced the RAM SIMOS battery and cleaned the CPU, but the CPU was not starting, so we replaced the CPU, SSD, and hard disk. The system was taking time to boot so we changed it to booting mode.
4. Google sheets download and provide to user.
5. Regular ERP Tasks work.
```

3. go to this file /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf and edit this file
 <VirtualHost *:80>

        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this

and change this line
