Please follow the process.  
To change PHP version you need to disable one PHP version first then you need to enable second PHP version.  
commands are given below-  
to disable a php version - sudo a2dismod php<version>  
to enable a php version - sudo a2enmod php<version>  
you need to restart Apache services every time once you will switch PHP version.  
the command to restart apache services is given below -  
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart  
you need to enable only one PHP version at a time.  
and you can check enabled PHP version using info.php file, in the terminal if you will check PHP version it will show the highest version installed.  
I have provided you access to update PHP alternatives using the command, you can set alternative of PHP according to the PHP version you have enabled.  
sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php<version>
